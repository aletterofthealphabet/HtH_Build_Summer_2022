# Why are you interested in this dataset

I'm interested in this data set because it relates to my internship

---

This dataset came from [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download). "Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions."

# What are 10 (or more) questions that you hope to answer through your data analysis?

No. | Question
:-:|:-
1 | Does does pH affect potability?
2 | Does water hardness affect potability?
3 | Does potability affect conductivity?
4 | How much water is potable in the dataset?
5 | Does sulfate affect potability?
6 | Does trihalomethanes affect potability?
7 | Does organic carbons affect potability?
8 | What is the average ph of the water samples?
9 | What is the average hardness of the water samples?
10 | What is the average portability of the water samples?
