I'm interested in this data set because it relates to my internship

---

This dataset came from [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download). "Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions."
